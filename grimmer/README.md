Summary of implemented features:
- This application is the read only version so it doesn't allow the user to be created or 
modify things. But it have the capabilities to show how is going to be when is finished.
- The first thing the user can see is the log in page, here he go to see the new user form, 
enter to the normal user part of the app and finally he can go to the admin part using a link. 
this link is only going to be available in the readonly version because in later versions of 
the app he will have to enter his email and password and the app will now if the user is normal
or an admin.
- When the user enter to the normal users part he can navigate throw the different pages of 
the application that normal user are allow to see. He can see his profile, the different posts, 
the delete page and all the wireframes of the assignment 1.2.
- The same thing happen when when the user click on the admin link of the log in page,
he can see all of the wireframnes of that the admin is allow to see including the super admin views
- A database was created to show some post and users. The objective of this is that the user 
can have a better read only experience and analyse better what the app should do.

Summary of features required in the assignment but pending:
-When an user click on the title of a post he can see the full post view as described in the las 
assignment but he can only see the first post even when he pres in another post title. So this 
feature is pending for the next assignment but it show how the app should work.
