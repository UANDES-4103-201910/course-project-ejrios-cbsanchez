In this assignment we accomplish several features:

-The user can log in with google authetication or creating a local user with a correct email address
with the registration form. The user can also log out from the session.

-If the user doesn't have an account he can create one with his email.

-When the user is logged in  he can change the password to enter the app. If he forget the password
we manage to create a form to recover it but we couldn't manage to send the email without publish 
our personal password in the app.

-An user can modify his profile information, add a picture, change his biography, etc. He also can
view, create, update and delete his own posts and also create and edit commentaries.

-The user can see other people posts, comment them, up vote and down vote the post. Also he can see 
the author profile. We couldn't manage to follow a post or mark it as inappropiate.

-The user can search other users and other posts.

-The app recognise the type of user (normal, admin or super admin ) when he is trying to log in and
redirect him to the correct view.

-The administrator can see the users in the blacklist and get them out of it. He also can search for
a specific user in the blacklist. The same thing can be done with the post in the dumblist.

-The admin can see the full post and the full user profile. He also can edit the user profile.

-A new administrator can be created, updated and deleted.

-The application show feedback to the user with a green tag when the operation is correct and a 
red tag when not.
